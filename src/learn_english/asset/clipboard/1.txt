date: 2017-02-10

228. congestion
usage: tcp also provides congestion control. congestion control is not so much a service provided to the invoking application as it is a service for the internet as a whole, a service for the general good.
date: 2017-02-10

244. blast
usage: udp just blasts away without any formal pre- liminaries.
date: 2017-02-10

245. periodically
usage: since rip updates are sent periodically (typi- cally every five minutes), lost updates will be replaced by more recent updates, thus making the lost, out-of-date update useless. udp is also used to carry network manage- ment (snmp; see chapter 9) data.
date: 2017-02-10

246. oblivious
usage: in fact, the intermediate routers are completely oblivious to tcp connections;
date: 2017-02-10

date: 2017-02-10

250. reclaim
usage: if the client does not send an ack to complete the third step of this 3-way handshake, eventually (often after a minute or more) the server will terminate the half- open connection and reclaim the allocated resources.
date: 2017-02-10

251. deluge
usage: with this deluge of syn segments, the server’s connection resources become exhausted as they are allocated (but never used!) for half-open connections
date: 2017-02-10

usage: caching and other sharing methods will not alleviate it
date: 2017-02-10

date: 2017-04-30

401. congestion
usage: tcp also provides congestion control. congestion control is not so much a service provided to the invoking application as it is a service for the internet as a whole, a service for the general good.
date: 2017-04-30

402. swamping

usage: since real-time applications often require a minimum sending rate, do not want to overly delay segment transmission, and can tolerate some data loss, tcp’s service model is not partic- ularly well matched to these applications’ needs.
date: 2017-04-30

417. blast
usage: udp just blasts away without any formal pre- liminaries.
date: 2017-04-30

418. periodically
usage: since rip updates are sent periodically (typi- cally every five minutes), lost updates will be replaced by more recent updates, thus making the lost, out-of-date update useless. udp is also used to carry network manage- ment (snmp; see chapter 9) data.
date: 2017-04-30

419. oblivious
usage: in fact, the intermediate routers are completely oblivious to tcp connections;
date: 2017-04-30

420. impose
usage: thus, the third segment arrived out of order. the subtle issue is: what does a host do when it receives out-of-order segments in a tcp con- nection? interestingly, the tcp rfcs do not impose any rules here and leave the decision up to the people programming a tcp implementation.
date: 2017-04-30

421. compliant

date: 2017-04-30

423. reclaim
usage: if the client does not send an ack to complete the third step of this 3-way handshake, eventually (often after a minute or more) the server will terminate the half- open connection and reclaim the allocated resources.
date: 2017-04-30

424. deluge
usage: with this deluge of syn segments, the server’s connection resources become exhausted as they are allocated (but never used!) for half-open connections
date: 2017-04-30

425. alleviate
usage: caching and other sharing methods will not alleviate it
date: 2017-04-30

426. scalability
usage: if you have enough socket's in time_wait then your ability to create new socket connections may be affected and this can affect the scalability of your client server system.
date: 2017-04-30

427. workshop
usage: when we conduct a technical workshop, a common query from the participants relates to the maximum transmission unit (mtu) size manipulation on a router interface and its relationship with the tcp maximum segment size (mss).

date: 2017-04-30

566. congestion
usage: tcp also provides congestion control. congestion control is not so much a service provided to the invoking application as it is a service for the internet as a whole, a service for the general good.
date: 2017-04-30

usage: since real-time applications often require a minimum sending rate, do not want to overly delay segment transmission, and can tolerate some data loss, tcp’s service model is not partic- ularly well matched to these applications’ needs.
date: 2017-04-30

582. blast
usage: udp just blasts away without any formal pre- liminaries.
date: 2017-04-30

583. periodically
usage: since rip updates are sent periodically (typi- cally every five minutes), lost updates will be replaced by more recent updates, thus making the lost, out-of-date update useless. udp is also used to carry network manage- ment (snmp; see chapter 9) data.
date: 2017-04-30

584. oblivious
usage: in fact, the intermediate routers are completely oblivious to tcp connections;
date: 2017-04-30

585. impose
usage: thus, the third segment arrived out of order. the subtle issue is: what does a host do when it receives out-of-order segments in a tcp con- nection? interestingly, the tcp rfcs do not impose any rules here and leave the decision up to the people programming a tcp implementation.
date: 2017-04-30

586. compliant

date: 2017-04-30

588. reclaim
usage: if the client does not send an ack to complete the third step of this 3-way handshake, eventually (often after a minute or more) the server will terminate the half- open connection and reclaim the allocated resources.
date: 2017-04-30

589. deluge
usage: with this deluge of syn segments, the server’s connection resources become exhausted as they are allocated (but never used!) for half-open connections
date: 2017-04-30

590. alleviate
usage: caching and other sharing methods will not alleviate it
date: 2017-04-30

date: 2017-04-30

592. workshop
usage: when we conduct a technical workshop, a common query from the participants relates to the maximum transmission unit (mtu) size manipulation on a router interface and its relationship with the tcp maximum segment size (mss).

date: 2017-04-30

725. congestion
usage: tcp also provides congestion control. congestion control is not so much a service provided to the invoking application as it is a service for the internet as a whole, a service for the general good.

741. blast
usage: udp just blasts away without any formal pre- liminaries.
date: 2017-04-30

742. periodically
usage: since rip updates are sent periodically (typi- cally every five minutes), lost updates will be replaced by more recent updates, thus making the lost, out-of-date update useless. udp is also used to carry network manage- ment (snmp; see chapter 9) data.
date: 2017-04-30

743. oblivious
usage: in fact, the intermediate routers are completely oblivious to tcp connections;
date: 2017-04-30

744. impose
usage: thus, the third segment arrived out of order. the subtle issue is: what does a host do when it receives out-of-order segments in a tcp con- nection? interestingly, the tcp rfcs do not impose any rules here and leave the decision up to the people programming a tcp implementation.
date: 2017-04-30

date: 2017-04-30

747. reclaim
usage: if the client does not send an ack to complete the third step of this 3-way handshake, eventually (often after a minute or more) the server will terminate the half- open connection and reclaim the allocated resources.
date: 2017-04-30

748. deluge
usage: with this deluge of syn segments, the server’s connection resources become exhausted as they are allocated (but never used!) for half-open connections
date: 2017-04-30

749. alleviate
usage: caching and other sharing methods will not alleviate it
date: 2017-04-30

date: 2017-07-06

903. congestion
usage: tcp also provides congestion control. congestion control is not so much a service provided to the invoking application as it is a service for the internet as a whole, a service for the general good.
date: 2017-07-06

919. blast
usage: udp just blasts away without any formal pre- liminaries.
date: 2017-07-06

920. periodically
usage: since rip updates are sent periodically (typi- cally every five minutes), lost updates will be replaced by more recent updates, thus making the lost, out-of-date update useless. udp is also used to carry network manage- ment (snmp; see chapter 9) data.
date: 2017-07-06

921. oblivious
usage: in fact, the intermediate routers are completely oblivious to tcp connections;
date: 2017-07-06

922. impose
usage: thus, the third segment arrived out of order. the subtle issue is: what does a host do when it receives out-of-order segments in a tcp con- nection? interestingly, the tcp rfcs do not impose any rules here and leave the decision up to the people programming a tcp implementation.
date: 2017-07-06

date: 2017-07-06

925. reclaim
usage: if the client does not send an ack to complete the third step of this 3-way handshake, eventually (often after a minute or more) the server will terminate the half- open connection and reclaim the allocated resources.
date: 2017-07-06

926. deluge
usage: with this deluge of syn segments, the server’s connection resources become exhausted as they are allocated (but never used!) for half-open connections
date: 2017-07-06

927. alleviate
usage: caching and other sharing methods will not alleviate it
date: 2017-07-06

date: 2017-07-06

1082. congestion
usage: tcp also provides congestion control. congestion control is not so much a service provided to the invoking application as it is a service for the internet as a whole, a service for the general good.
date: 2017-07-06

usage: since real-time applications often require a minimum sending rate, do not want to overly delay segment transmission, and can tolerate some data loss, tcp’s service model is not partic- ularly well matched to these applications’ needs.
date: 2017-07-06

1098. blast
usage: udp just blasts away without any formal pre- liminaries.
date: 2017-07-06

1099. periodically
usage: since rip updates are sent periodically (typi- cally every five minutes), lost updates will be replaced by more recent updates, thus making the lost, out-of-date update useless. udp is also used to carry network manage- ment (snmp; see chapter 9) data.
date: 2017-07-06

1100. oblivious
usage: in fact, the intermediate routers are completely oblivious to tcp connections;
date: 2017-07-06

1101. impose
usage: thus, the third segment arrived out of order. the subtle issue is: what does a host do when it receives out-of-order segments in a tcp con- nection? interestingly, the tcp rfcs do not impose any rules here and leave the decision up to the people programming a tcp implementation.
date: 2017-07-06

1102. compliant

date: 2017-07-06

1104. reclaim
usage: if the client does not send an ack to complete the third step of this 3-way handshake, eventually (often after a minute or more) the server will terminate the half- open connection and reclaim the allocated resources.
date: 2017-07-06

1105. deluge
usage: with this deluge of syn segments, the server’s connection resources become exhausted as they are allocated (but never used!) for half-open connections
date: 2017-07-06

1106. alleviate
usage: caching and other sharing methods will not alleviate it
date: 2017-07-06

1107. scalability

date: 2017-07-06

1108. workshop
usage: when we conduct a technical workshop, a common query from the participants relates to the maximum transmission unit (mtu) size manipulation on a router interface and its relationship with the tcp maximum segment size (mss).

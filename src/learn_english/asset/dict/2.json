    "eng_basic": "Suspicious behavior inspires distrust. Prancing around your backyard in a trench coat and fake mustache during daylight might elicit weird looks from your neighbors; do it at night, though, so that your silhouette glides past their windows, and what appeared innocent enough hours before will quickly transition to suspicious . Use this adjective to describe a behavior or event that arouses doubt or mistrust. How to avoid appearing suspicious ? Well, for one, stop pausing mid-conversation to take covert notes in that little journal of yours. And two, don\u2019t wear sunglasses indoors, and don\u2019t try to walk without making a sound. That will make people cagey, which is a synonym for suspicious .  Other synonyms include apprehensive , doubtful , wary , and watchful .",

Anything you're putting for is being postponed: people postpone things they don't have time to do or just don't want to do. Since doctor and dental appointments are no fun, people postpone them a lot. You can postpone small things, like going to the store or watching a video. The government can postpone big things, like the passing of bills or the invasion of another country. People who procrastinate are constantly postponing.

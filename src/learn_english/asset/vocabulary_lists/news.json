Albee was known for writing intense plays about regret and despair, and how people adapt to these emotions. A winner of multiple Tony Awards and three Pulitzer Prizes as well as the acclaim of a generation of critics and his peers alike, Albee had an adversarial relationship with critics and didn't seem to care too much about praise. His outlook can be summed up by this line from The Play About The Baby : \"If you have no wounds, how can you know if you're alive?\" Albee's art was about exploring these wounds.

Moore starred in two ground-breaking television series, The Dick Van Dyke show and The Mary Tyler Moore show. The latter was the first popular television show which revolved around a single career woman. Moore's self-titled show wasn't primarily an issue-oriented program, however; it was concerned with being laugh-out-loud funny. The episode where Mary gets the giggles at the funeral of Chuckles the Clown is a classic. Moore was a Tony and Emmy Award winner, and she was nominated for an Oscar for \"Ordinary People.\" She became a spokeswoman for diabetes research when she was diagnosed with the disease. Here are 10 quotes from Mary Tyler Moore."

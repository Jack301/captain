As a noun, it can mean \"an open sore on the back of a horse caused by a saddle\" (this would continue the horse and rider/people and law enforcement metaphor). In humans, gall is \"a digestive juice secreted by the liver\" which was once thought to produce \"a feeling of deep and bitter anger and ill-will.\" Because the Duke wants his people to think highly of him, he does not punish them when they break the rules.

Especially since the act of fornication has not been punished for 19 years. sentencing Claudio to death for it now seems uncalled for.",

        "word_description": "In Latin, \"sanctus\" means \"holy\" and \"monium\" is a suffix meaning \"state, condition\" so the English adjective sounds like it should be a compliment.

Here, Isabella says she wants strict rules, which suggests that she might have trouble disciplining herself. Although the audience is never told why Isabella is considering entering a nunnery, the Duke's words to the friar suggest that one reason can be a broken heart.

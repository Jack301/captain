## Awesome Tool for Leaning English

### What it is

Captain is a smart clipboard recorder, a dictionary and a vocabulary builder which was build for leaning English.

### Features

#### Smart Clipboard Recorder

It is very essential to record the vocabulary and the sentence in which you stuck and can't recognize the word when you read English articles ro English novels. If you can learn words from a vivid or meaningful sentence in which you stuck other than a trivial example from dictionary, you would gain much efficiency when leaning English.

#### Dictionary

Captain of cource can look up words. As a matter of fact, Captain requests and gets word meaning from website http://dict.youdao.com/, then it will record that in local dicionary file.

#### Vocabulary Builder

Captain is originally designed as an assistant partner of Kindle E-reader.Frankly to say, I think Kinle is awesome to leaning English. When we look up words on Kindle, they are automatically added to the Vocabulary Builder on the device. With Vocabulary Builder, we can use flashcards to learn the definitions and usage of words. But as a long term user, I think Kindle has a serious shortcoming which is lack of excellent management functionary of vocabulary builder, and this is why I created this project origionally.

#### Kindle Exporter

For convenience, Captain can automatically exportes the words in 'mastered' category on Kindle vocabulary builder, it will delete those them on Kindle and synchronize to Kindle. But currently, you need manually reboot Kindle after exporting to make synchronization valid.

### Running the app

```Bash 
sh run.sh
```

Open your browser, enter the url http://localhost:5000/. 

Have fun!
